Sampling API Documentation
=========================

The Sampling project provides functions to perform random sampling and
sub-sampling of any iterable.  Many functions are lazy such that they input
an iterable and output an iterator, thus allowing them to support arbitrarily
large streaming data sets.

**Sampling is in alpha.  Contributions welcome.**
