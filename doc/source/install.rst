Installation and Dependencies
=============================

Sampling is pure Python and so is easily installable by the standard
dependency managers ``pip`` and ``easy_install``::

    easy_install sampling

or::

    pip install sampling

Sampling endeavors to be a very light dependency.  It accomplishes this in
three ways:

1.  Sampling is pure Python
2.  Sampling relies only on the standard library
3.  Sampling simultaneously supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3
